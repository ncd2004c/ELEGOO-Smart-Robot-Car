# ELEGOO-Smart-Robot-Car
My group in IT- 254 is building Autonomous ELEGOO  Smart Robot Car to go into the garage. We made a camera with a teachable machine model identy the car and then send a signal to an Audino to run a motor to open up the garage door for the car to go in.

Supplies:
Elegoo Smart Robot Car Version 4 with a camera that has an Arduino attached to it
Camera from an old webcam for the garage door
Wood For Gargage and Door
motor

Research:
How python code communicate with Audino Code
Making teachable machince code run in VScode
How to only send a singal to Audino if the code identifies the car
