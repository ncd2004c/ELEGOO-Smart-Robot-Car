# ELEGOO-Smart-Robot-Car
My group in IT- 254 is building Autonomous ELEGOO  Smart Robot Car. We plan to for this car to have object avoidence and traverse an area to get to it "home" where we will have a garage door automatically open for it when the car gets near.

Supplies:
Elegoo Smart Robot Car Version 4 with a camera that has an Arduino attached to it
Camera from an old webcam for the garage door

Research:
How to build the garage
What models we are going to use
