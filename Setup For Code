A couple things to know for the set up the code. 
First you need to have the script in the same file as the teachable machine data file and label files.
Second thing is with whatever code editor you are using make sure you are running python 3.11.
You also going to need to install pyserial (communicate with Audino), opencv-python (Camera), and tensorflow version 2.12 (To handle data file).
